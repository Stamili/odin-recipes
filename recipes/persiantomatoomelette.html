        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Here is my favorite variant of this recipe, simply because it's fast and easy to make (not to mention, very delicious too).</p>
            <p>These ingredients and their volume are accounted for me, myself and I, but there is a chance a forth person could join in too. I recommend experimenting with the amount of tomato paste, as some may like it higher or lower than others.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>6 eggs</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons of tomato paste</li>
                <li>1 medium onion</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Saut√© the tomato paste over medium heat, stirring the entire time until it falls apart and no longer sticks together.</li>
                <li>Lower the heat and add the eggs. don't stir for a minute or two. let the egg whites show.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, prepare the onion by cutting it to 4 pieces and putting it on your table, you are eating it raw with the omelette.</li>
                <li>Mix and stir the eggs and tomato paste so they become uniform. When it's done, you should have your orange (or red, if you fancy tomatoes) omelette ready.</li>
                <li>Serve with bread, Enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
